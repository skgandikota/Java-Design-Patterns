# Creational Design Patterns

Creational design patterns provide solution to *`instantiate a object`* in the best possible way for specific situations.

## 1. Singleton Pattern

Singleton pattern *`restricts the instantiation of a class and ensures that only one instance of the class exists`* in the Java virtual machine.

## 2. Factory Pattern

The factory design pattern is used *`when we have a superclass with multiple sub-classes and based on input, we need to return one of the sub-class`*. This pattern takes out the responsibility of the instantiation of a class from the client program to the factory class.

## 3. Abstract Factory Pattern

Abstract Factory pattern is similar to Factory pattern and itâ€™s a *`factory of factories`*. If you are familiar with the factory design pattern in java, you will notice that we have a single Factory class that returns the different sub-classes based on the input provided and the factory class uses if-else or switch statements to achieve this.

In Abstract Factory pattern, we get rid of if-else block and have a *`factory class for each sub-class and then an Abstract Factory class that will return the sub-class based on the input factory class`*.

## 4. Builder Pattern

This pattern was introduced to solve some of the problems with Factory and Abstract Factory design patterns when the Object contains a lot of attributes. Builder ```pattern solves the issue with a large number of optional parameters and inconsistent state by providing a way to build the object step-by-step and provide a method that will actually return the final Object```

## 5. Prototype Pattern

The prototype pattern ```is used when the Object creation is a costly affair and requires a lot of time and resources and you have a similar object already existing. So this pattern provides a mechanism to copy the original object to a new object and then modify it according to our needs```. This pattern uses java cloning to copy the object.
