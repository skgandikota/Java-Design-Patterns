# JAVA DESIGN PATTERNS

A design patterns are well-proved Industry Standand Robust solution for solving the specific problem/task. let us see where we use design patterns with a problem statement. 

### Problem Given:

`Suppose you have some database which accept only one thread for CRUD Operations which means you want to create a program for which only a database connection single instance (or object) should be created and that single object can be used by all other classes.`

### Solution:

`Singleton design pattern is the best solution of above specific problem.`

 Cool Right ! So, every design pattern has some specification or set of rules for solving the problems.
